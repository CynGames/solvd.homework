## Task 1 ## 
Make a function to calc n-th fibonacci number with caching in 2 ways, one with Map and one with WeakMap

`The n-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)th and the (n-2)th. 
So to calculate the 100th Fibonacci number, for instance, we need to compute all the 99 values before it first.`

## Solution ##

The `fibonacci.js` file contains the solution for this task.
